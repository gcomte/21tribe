# 21 TRIBE

Community-driven calendar for Bitcoin events: [21tribe.site](https://21tribe.site)

### Add Events
1. Copy [this template](https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/blob/main/_data/CONFERENCE-TEMPLATE.yaml) and fill out *all* necessary information as accurately as possible.  
2. Rename the file to fit the following pattern: `date-of-first-conference-day_CITY_CONFERENCE-NAME.yaml` (for example: `2024-04-03_LOS-COBANOS_BITCOIN-HALVING-PARTY.yaml`)  
3.
    - If you are able to, create a Pull Request that places that file into [the conferences directory](https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/tree/main/_data/conferences).  
    - If the point above is is too hard for you, submit your file to [our Telegram group](https://t.me/btctribe).
4. Be available for potential questions about the event and wait  
5. Update us about any changes through a PR or in the telegram group
6. For even more visibility, [share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Just%20added%20%5BCONFERENCE-NAME%5D%20to%2021tribe.site%21%20%40the21tribe) that you've included your conference! We will retweet!

### Minimal Events Index

21 TRIBE aims to provide a minimalist platform solely dedicated to indexing Bitcoin Events. Our focus remains on delivering a concise overview. For detailed information, users are encouraged to visit the respective conference websites; we prioritize simplicity and do not delve into event specifics on 21 TRIBE.

### Roadmap

[ ] Filter by dates  
[ ] Filter by language  
[ ] Filter by continent  
[ ] List past events  
[ ] CSV export (using applied filters  
[ ] Calendar entry export ([.ics](https://icalendar.org/)) per event  
[ ] Calendar entry export ([.ics](https://icalendar.org/)) for entire list, using applied filters  
[ ] Map view  
[ ] More convenient way to add events  


### Contribute

I lack expertise in design and front-end development. However, recognizing the lack of such a list for the Bitcoin community, I took it upon myself to create it, as it remains unaddressed by others thus far.

So any help is welcome!
