# 21 TRIBE

[Community-driven](https://t.me/btctribe) calendar for Bitcoin events: [21tribe.site](https://21tribe.site)

### Add Events

Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQdHLj1yj-KaCiLvW8eDxjuPkhJrtN56Mv3w-1K_AjzNLdfw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  
It might take a couple of days until your event is listed.

#### Speed up the process
If you are able to, you can also add events directly to the site by following these steps:

1. Copy [this template](https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/blob/main/_data/CONFERENCE-TEMPLATE.yaml) and fill out *all* necessary information as accurately as possible.  
2. Rename the file to fit the following pattern: `date-of-first-conference-day_CITY_CONFERENCE-NAME.yaml` (for example: `2024-04-03_LOS-COBANOS_BITCOIN-HALVING-PARTY.yaml`)  
3. Create a Pull Request that places that file into [the conferences directory](https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/tree/main/_data/conferences).
4. Respond to potential questions about the event on your Pull Request
5. Congrats! Your event is now listed on 21 TRIBE!
6. For even more visibility, [share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%5BCONFERENCE-NAME%5D%20is%20now%20on%20%40the21tribe%21%20%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%9A%80%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2F21tribe.site) that you've included your conference! We will retweet!
7. Update us about any changes through a PR or in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/btctribe)

### Minimal Events Index

21 TRIBE aims to provide a minimalist platform solely dedicated to indexing Bitcoin Events. Our focus remains on delivering a concise overview. For detailed information, users are encouraged to visit the respective conference websites; we prioritize simplicity and do not delve into event specifics on 21 TRIBE.

### Roadmap
[x] Filter by language  
[x] Filter by continent  
[x] More convenient way to add events  
[ ] Filter by dates  
[ ] List past events  
[ ] CSV export (using applied filters  
[ ] Calendar entry export ([.ics](https://icalendar.org/)) per event  
[ ] Calendar entry export ([.ics](https://icalendar.org/)) for entire list, using applied filters  
[ ] Map view  


### Contribute

I lack expertise in design and front-end development. However, recognizing the lack of such a list for the Bitcoin community, I took it upon myself to create it, as it remains unaddressed by others thus far.

So any help is welcome!
