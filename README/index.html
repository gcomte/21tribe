<p>Community-driven calendar for Bitcoin events</p>
<h3>Add Events</h3>
<ol>
<li>Copy <a href="https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/blob/main/_data/CONFERENCE-TEMPLATE.yaml">this template</a> and fill out <em>all</em> necessary information as accurately as possible.</li>
<li>Rename the file to fit the following pattern: <code>date-of-first-conference-day_CITY_CONFERENCE-NAME.yaml</code> (for example: `2024-04-03_LOS-COBANOS_BITCOIN-HALVING-PARTY.yaml)<br>
3.a) If you are able to, creat a Pull Request that places that file into <a href="https://github.com/gcomte/21tribe/tree/main/_data/conferences">the conferences directory</a>.
3.b) If 3.a is too hard for you, submit your file to <a href="https://t.me/btctribe">our Telegram group</a>.</li>
<li>Be available for potential questions about the event</li>
<li>Update us about any changes through a PR or in the telegram group</li>
</ol>
<h3>Minimal Events Index</h3>
<p>21 TRIBE aims to provide a minimalist platform solely dedicated to indexing Bitcoin Events. Our focus remains on delivering a concise overview. For detailed information, users are encouraged to visit the respective conference websites; we prioritize simplicity and do not delve into event specifics on 21 TRIBE.</p>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>[ ] Filter by dates<br>
[ ] Filter by language<br>
[ ] Filter by continent<br>
[ ] List past events<br>
[ ] Map view<br>
[ ] More convenient way to add events</p>
<h3>Contribute</h3>
<p>I lack expertise in design and front-end development. However, recognizing the lack of such a list for the Bitcoin community, I took it upon myself to create it, as it remains unaddressed by others thus far.</p>
<p>So any help is welcome!<br>
