Our focus remains on delivering a concise overview. For detailed information, users are encouraged to visit the respective conference websites; we prioritize simplicity and do not delve into event specifics on 21 TRIBE.</p><h3>Roadmap</h3><p>[x] Filter by language<br>[x] Filter by continent<br>[x] More convenient way to add events<br>[ ] Filter by dates<br>[ ] List past events<br>[ ] CSV export (using applied filters<br>[ ] Calendar entry export (<a href="https://icalendar.org/">.ics</a>) per event<br>[ ] Calendar entry export (<a href="https://icalendar.org/">.ics</a>) for entire list, using applied filters<br>[ ] Map view</p><h3>Contribute</h3><p>I lack expertise in design and front-end development. However, recognizing the lack of such a list for the Bitcoin community, I took it upon myself to create it, as it remains unaddressed by others thus far.</p><p>So any help is welcome!<br>Get in touch with us on <a href="https://t.me/btctribe">Telegram</a></p>
