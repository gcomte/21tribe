<h3>Minimal Events Index</h3>
<p>21 TRIBE aims to provide a minimalist platform solely dedicated to indexing Bitcoin Events. Our focus remains on delivering a concise overview. For detailed information, users are encouraged to visit the respective conference websites; we prioritize simplicity and do not delve into event specifics on 21 TRIBE.</p>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>[ ] Filter by dates<br>
[ ] Filter by language<br>
[ ] Filter by continent<br>
[ ] List past events<br>
[ ] CSV export (using applied filters<br>
[ ] Calendar entry export (<a href="https://icalendar.org/">.ics</a>) per event<br>
[ ] Calendar entry export (<a href="https://icalendar.org/">.ics</a>) for entire list, using applied filters<br>
[ ] Map view<br>
[ ] More convenient way to add events</p>
<h3>Contribute</h3>
<p>I lack expertise in design and front-end development. However, recognizing the lack of such a list for the Bitcoin community, I took it upon myself to create it, as it remains unaddressed by others thus far.</p>
<p>So any help is welcome!<br>
